# Introduction

C792 is an HDMI-to-CSI-2 conversion module with HDMI loop-out and support for I2S audio output.

The HDMI input supports up to 4K 60Hz, and the HDMI loop-out displays the same content as the HDMI input.

The CSI-2 output supports up to 1080p 60Hz (4K input will automatically scale down to 1080p while maintaining the refresh rate).

# Instructions

The hardware solution consists of GSV2001 and TC358743, where GSV2001 implements HDMI splitting functionality, and TC358743 handles HDMI-to-CSI-2 conversion.

- To ensure stable operation of the module, it is strongly recommended to power the module via the 5V power interface.

- When the "HDMI loop-out" is connected to a display, the HDMI source detects the display connected to the "HDMI loop-out." When the "HDMI loop-out" is not connected to a display, the HDMI source detects the TC358743-simulated display.

- The CSI-2 interface (15-pin) is a 2-channel CSI-2 interface used to connect Raspberry Pi Zero, 3B, and 4B, supporting up to 1080p 50Hz capture. The CSI-2 interface (22-pin) is a 4-channel CSI-2 interface used to connect Raspberry Pi CM4, CM5, and 5B, supporting up to 1080p 60Hz capture.
